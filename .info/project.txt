We are asking you to implement an automated test suite for a critical path on the https://oliver.space website: the purchase flow. Specifically, starting from the products page, adding one or more products to the shopping cart, editing the shopping cart, and checking out. Since actually checking out requires a credit card charge, please stop before hitting the purchase button.


Please take a few minutes to look at this flow and identify the most important things to test. We are looking for just a few test cases that are the highest priority, in your opinion. We are not asking for a test suite with comprehensive coverage. Once you have identified the test cases you want to focus on, please document them and implement automated tests for them. 


Please limit yourself to no more than 3 hours of work. We donâ€™t want to take up too much of your time, and we are not expecting perfection.


We are looking for 2 deliverables:

The description of test cases you are covering. This can be in freeform text or any format you choose. 

The code implementing the test cases. This can be written to use any programming languages and tools you choose, just please include instructions for running it. 


We will evaluate your work on the following criteria:

The choice and prioritization of the test cases.

Resilience of your implementation to slow page response times, DOM structure changes, etc.

Your coding style: modularity, reusability, readability.
